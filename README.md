# OpenMinecraft Launcher  
*A modern, fast, and open-source Minecraft launcher built for everyone.*

🚀 **Development in Progress** – This is an early-stage project. Contributions, feedback, and ideas are welcome!

## 📖 Description

**OpenMinecraft** is a lightweight, customizable Minecraft launcher designed from the ground up with performance, simplicity, and extensibility in mind.  
Unlike many existing launchers, OpenMinecraft is fully open-source, ad-free, and built by the community for the community.

We aim to provide:
- 🔧 **Full modding support** (Fabric, Forge, Quilt, and more)
- 🎨 **Clean, modern UI** with customizable themes
- ⚡ **Fast launch times** and low resource usage
- 📦 **Built-in instance management** for different Minecraft versions and modpacks
- 🔄 **Automatic updates** for the launcher and game components
- 🌍 **Multi-platform support** (Windows, macOS, Linux)

This project is currently in **active development** – core features are being implemented, and the architecture is being refined.
